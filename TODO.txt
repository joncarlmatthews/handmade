Day 035:
 -x Collapse tile spam into single loop
 -x Add z-index to player position
 -x Draw up/down doors
 -x Only show up/down if room has no exit
 -x shift and mask to store chunk and tile in the same 32 bit integer?

Ongoing:
 -x Slow frame rate (now that we're rendering pixel by pixel)
 -x Fix player speed/frame rate consistency? Not sure how to resolve this atm. Will revisit.
 -x Diagonal speed bug (will fix when implement vectors)
 -x Collision detection bug where rounding means player doesnt get a close as possible to certain tiles when a move is invalid
 -x Postfix pixel variables with Px (tidy up, where appropiate)
  -x Deprecate modulo function?? Why doesnt the mod operator suffice??
