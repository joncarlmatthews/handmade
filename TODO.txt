Day 043
 -x build.bat needs to be updated now I have refactored project
 -x Switch build.bat to use clang-tidy.exe. Will have to migrate away from batch file to Powershell script it seems for this.

Ongoing:
 -x shift and mask to store chunk and tile in the same 32 bit integer?
 -x Collision detection bug where rounding means player doesnt get a close as possible to certain tiles when a move is invalid
 -x Make DEBUG_platformWriteEntireFile relative to current working directory like the read function
 -x deprecate math.h
 -x Move sub-includes from .h into .cpp. https://chat.openai.com/c/ff0b6e06-c7a7-4f12-bc8e-f045a159dedd
 -x Support for drawing bitmap at different size to that of the original asset.
 -x Support for scaling bitmaps. When the asset is drawn at smaller scale (via resizing the window) it tears.
 -x Add linter as part of pre-commit hook. Something like Stylecop?
