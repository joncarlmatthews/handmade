-/ Move tilemap to memory
-x Implement tileChunks
-x Implement chunk mask & shift
    - Tilemap has a number of tile chunks. Each tile chunk has n number of tiles
    - absolute tile x and y
    - which 256x256 chunk are we viewing?
    - chunk relative tile x and ys

Ongoing:
- Slow frame rate (now that we're rendering pixel by pixel)
- Fix player speed/frame rate consistency? Not sure how to resolve this atm. Will revisit.
- Diagonal speed bug (will fix when implement vectors)
- Collision detection bug where rounding means player doesnt get a close as possible to certain tiles when a move is invalid
- Postfix pixel variables with Px (tidy up, where appropiate)
