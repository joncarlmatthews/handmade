Day 035:
 -x Collapse tile spam into single loop
 -x Draw up/down doors
 -x Only show up/down if room has no exit
 -x shift and mask to store chunk and tile in the same 32 bit integer?
 -x update command line build script

Ongoing:
 -x Fix player speed/frame rate consistency? Not sure how to resolve this atm. Will revisit.
 -x Diagonal speed bug (will fix when implement vectors)
 -x Collision detection bug where rounding means player doesnt get a close as possible to certain tiles when a move is invalid
