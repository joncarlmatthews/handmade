- Create tilemap.cpp and move declarations over
- Move tile map to memory
- Implement sparse world storage
     - absolute tile x and y
     - which 256x256 chunk are we viewing?
     - chunk relative tile x and y
- Tile relative offset needs to be in metres, not pixels? (as per Casey)

Ongoing:
- Slow frame rate (now that we're rendering pixel by pixel)
- Fix player speed/frame rate consistency? Not sure how to resolve this atm. Will revisit.
- Diagonal speed bug (will fix when implement vectors)
- Collision detection bug where rounding means player doesnt get a close as possible to certain tiles when a move is invalid
- Postfix pixel variables with Px (tidy up, where appropiate)
