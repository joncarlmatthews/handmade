Day 042:
 -/ Fun with vectors!
 -/ For position objects/attributes, refactor xyuint and xyint to new 2d vector class
 -/ Migrate from writeRectangleInt to writeRectangle
 -/ Player height and width is now no longer initialised as pixels but as metres. Need to adjust
 -x Copy 32-bit analyze compiler flags from VS to batch file

Ongoing:
 -x shift and mask to store chunk and tile in the same 32 bit integer?
 -x Fix player speed/frame rate consistency? Not sure how to resolve this atm. Will revisit.
 -x Diagonal speed bug (will fix when implement vectors) Disabled diagonal movement for now.
 -x Collision detection bug where rounding means player doesnt get a close as possible to certain tiles when a move is invalid
 -x Make DEBUG_platformWriteEntireFile relative to current working directory like the read function
 -x deprecate math.h
 -x Move sub-includes from .h into .cpp. https://chat.openai.com/c/ff0b6e06-c7a7-4f12-bc8e-f045a159dedd
 -x Support for drawing bitmap at different size to that of the original asset.
 -x Support for scaling bitmaps. When the asset is drawn at smaller scale (via resizing the window) it tears.
 -x Configure VS to format code as per my style

Thoughts
 -x Remove operator overloading of Vector to make it C, not C++?
