Day 043
=======
- [x] Algebra
- [ ] Gustavo (game-physics-engine-programming)
- [ ] Complete day 43

Ongoing:
=======
- [ ] Rename Startup to Core?? Shared??
- [ ] shift and mask to store chunk and tile in the same 32 bit integer?
- [ ] Collision detection bug where rounding means player doesnt get a close as possible to certain tiles when a move is invalid
- [ ] Make DEBUG_platformWriteEntireFile relative to current working directory like the read function
- [ ] deprecate math.h
- [ ] Move sub-includes from .h into .cpp. https://chat.openai.com/c/ff0b6e06-c7a7-4f12-bc8e-f045a159dedd
- [ ] Support for drawing bitmap at different size to that of the original asset.
- [ ] Support for scaling bitmaps. When the asset is drawn at smaller scale (via resizing the window) it tears.
- [ ] Add linter as part of pre-commit hook. Something like Stylecop?
- [ ] Revisit build.bat code analysis crap. Think I can rip all of this out as I only use built.bat as a convenient utility to enable hot-reloading in certain scenarios. Not for my main build pipeline (where i would want to catch those types of errors)

Random Thoughts:
================
- [ ] As per common wisdom, I blit to screen after calculating frame time. Is this blit causing the frame rate jerkiness? Won't refactor as waitng for writing a renderer.
