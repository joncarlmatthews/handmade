-/ Move tilemap to memory
-/ Implement tileChunks
-x Implement chunk mask & shift

Ongoing:
-x Slow frame rate (now that we're rendering pixel by pixel)
-x Fix player speed/frame rate consistency? Not sure how to resolve this atm. Will revisit.
-x Diagonal speed bug (will fix when implement vectors)
-x Collision detection bug where rounding means player doesnt get a close as possible to certain tiles when a move is invalid
-x Postfix pixel variables with Px (tidy up, where appropiate)
