Day 035:
 -x Implement sparse tilemap storage.
 -x Randomness
 -x Doors left/right/top/bottom

Ongoing:
 -x Slow frame rate (now that we're rendering pixel by pixel)
 -x Fix player speed/frame rate consistency? Not sure how to resolve this atm. Will revisit.
 -x Diagonal speed bug (will fix when implement vectors)
 -x Collision detection bug where rounding means player doesnt get a close as possible to certain tiles when a move is invalid
 -x Postfix pixel variables with Px (tidy up, where appropiate)
