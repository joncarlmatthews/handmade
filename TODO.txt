- Add tile drawing wrapping (toroidal topology)
- Access violation when moving down the X or Y axis. (gameState->worldPosition.chunkTiles pointer out of bounds)
- Revisit chunk mask and chunk shift stuff to store world position data in less bytes.
- Check tile collission detection still works
- Tile relative offset needs to be in metres, not pixels
 - Convert to sparse world by using tile chunks rather than individual tilemaps
     - absolute tile x and y
     - which 256x256 chunk are we viewing?
     - chunk relative tile x and y
 - Fix diagonal speed bug
 - move current active tile struct to within the player object (Meh, not sure actually)
