Day 042:
 -x Fun with vectors!
 - Convert int to float, and abstract away the uint type casting when writing to the buffers?
 - Create vector classes for integers and floats. Refactor xyuint and xyint to new 2d vevtor classes.
 - Configure VS to format code as per my style

Ongoing:
 -x shift and mask to store chunk and tile in the same 32 bit integer?
 -x Fix player speed/frame rate consistency? Not sure how to resolve this atm. Will revisit.
 -x Diagonal speed bug (will fix when implement vectors) Disabled diagonal movement for now.
 -x Collision detection bug where rounding means player doesnt get a close as possible to certain tiles when a move is invalid
 -x Make DEBUG_platformWriteEntireFile relative to current working directory like the read function
 -x deprecate math.h
 -x Move sub-includes from .h into .cpp. https://chat.openai.com/c/ff0b6e06-c7a7-4f12-bc8e-f045a159dedd
 -x Support for drawing bitmap at different size to that of the original asset. When the asset is drawn at the different size (via resizing the window) it tears.
