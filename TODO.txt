Day 043
=======
-[x] Algebra
-[ ] Gustavo (game-physics-engine-programming)
-[ ] Simplify Win32 message queue code as per SDL project
-[ ] Refactor delta time as per SDL.
-[ ] All movement values are "per second"
-[ ] Complete day 43

Ongoing:
=======
 -[] Static library project for the few shared functions I have? (GCD and byte conversions) Or just include .cpp file? 
 -[] shift and mask to store chunk and tile in the same 32 bit integer?
 -[] Collision detection bug where rounding means player doesnt get a close as possible to certain tiles when a move is invalid
 -[] Make DEBUG_platformWriteEntireFile relative to current working directory like the read function
 -[] deprecate math.h?
 -[] Move sub-includes from .h into .cpp. https://chat.openai.com/c/ff0b6e06-c7a7-4f12-bc8e-f045a159dedd
 -[] Support for drawing bitmap at different size to that of the original asset.
 -[] Support for scaling bitmaps. When the asset is drawn at smaller scale (via resizing the window) it tears.
 -[] Add linter as part of pre-commit hook. Something like Stylecop?
 -[] Revisit build.bat code analysis crap. Think I can rip all of this out as I only use built.bat as a convenient utility to enable hot-reloading in certain scenarios. Not for my main build pipeline (where i would want to catch those types of errors)

Random Thoughts:
================
- [] As per common wisdom, I blit to screen after calculating frame time. Is this blit causing the frame rate jerkiness? Won't refactor as waitng for writing as renderer.
