Day 034:
-/ Move tilemap to memory
-/ Implement tileChunks
-/ Implement chunk mask & shift
    - 32 bit integer.
    - Assuming 256x256 tile chunks:
        - bottom 8 bits would tell you which tile within the chunk
        - upper 24 bits would tell you which tile chunk

Day 035:
 -/ Change how I draw the world so that wraps based on total possible tiles
 -x Implement sparse tilemap storage

Ongoing:
-x Slow frame rate (now that we're rendering pixel by pixel)
-x Fix player speed/frame rate consistency? Not sure how to resolve this atm. Will revisit.
-x Diagonal speed bug (will fix when implement vectors)
-x Collision detection bug where rounding means player doesnt get a close as possible to certain tiles when a move is invalid
-x Postfix pixel variables with Px (tidy up, where appropiate)
