x Implement smooth scrolling (this might fix the wrapping glitch?)
x Stop player from moving (now that the background smooth scrolls)
    x Deprecate Plr Pixel Offset, player1.relativePosition?
    x Refactor Chunk Index, Chunk Tile, Chunk Plr Pos
x Make world toroidal
- Fix player speed/frame rate consistency? bug
- Make collision detection pixel based rather than tile based?
x Fix bug with point visulisation
x Re implement tile collission detection (currently disabled)

x Fix bug where world wrapping player movement glitches
- Revisit chunk mask and chunk shift stuff to store world position data in less bytes.
     - absolute tile x and y
     - which 256x256 chunk are we viewing?
     - chunk relative tile x and y
- Tile relative offset needs to be in metres, not pixels (as per Casey)

Ongoing:
- Fix diagonal speed bug
- Move forward declarations to releveant header files (tidy up)
- Postfix pixel variables with Px (tidy up, where appropiate)
