x Implement smooth scrolling (this might fix the wrapping glitch?)
- Stop player from moving (now that the background smooth scrolls)
- Make world toroidal
- Re implement tile collission detection (currently disabled)
- Postfix pixel variables with Px (where appropiate)
- Fix bug where world wrapping player movement glitches
- Revisit chunk mask and chunk shift stuff to store world position data in less bytes.
     - absolute tile x and y
     - which 256x256 chunk are we viewing?
     - chunk relative tile x and y
- Tile relative offset needs to be in metres, not pixels (as per Casey)
- Fix diagonal speed bug
