Day 038:
 - Remove background scrolling and move the camera per room. Make toggleable via a macro switch

Ongoing:
 -x shift and mask to store chunk and tile in the same 32 bit integer?
 -x Fix player speed/frame rate consistency? Not sure how to resolve this atm. Will revisit.
 -x Diagonal speed bug (will fix when implement vectors) Disabled diagonal movement for now.
 -x Collision detection bug where rounding means player doesnt get a close as possible to certain tiles when a move is invalid
 -x Make DEBUG_platformWriteEntireFile relative to current working directory like the read function
 -x deprecate math.h
 -x Move sub-includes from .h into .cpp
 -x Support for drawing bitmap at different size to that of the original asset
