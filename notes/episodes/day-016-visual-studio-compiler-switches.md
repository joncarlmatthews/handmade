# Day 016 - Visual Studio Compiler Switches

I'm not using the bash files and instead am using Visual Studio 2019 to run the build.

For each Project within the Solution:

To view the existing compiler flags, right click on the Project's name in the Solution Explorer and click on `Properties`. Then select `Configuration Properties` -> `C/C++` -> `Command Line`. In the top input box (`All Options`) you'll see the flags currently set. Note different flags will be set based on whether you're viewing the `Debug` or `Release` Configuration.

To add additional compiler flags, input them into the bottom input box (`Additional Options`). Note remember to have the correct Configuration selected (`Debug` or `Release`).

- -wd4201 (Don't warn on nameless struct/union)
- -wd4100 (Ignore unreferenced formal parameter warnings so we can take our [approach of handling unresolved externals](https://github.com/joncarlmatthews/private/blob/master/technical/learning/c-cpp.md#how-to-handle-unresolved-externals))
- /GR- (Disable run-time type checking as we wont use this)
- -D HANDMADE_LOCAL_BUILD=1 (For debug builds only add a custom HANDMADE_LOCAL_BUILD flag)
