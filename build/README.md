# Build

## Building

To build the source, run

`
> build.bat
`

Note, the first time you open the shell you'll need to run

`
> shell.bat
`

This sets the shell environment for building the source. This only needs to be done once per shell.

## Debuging

Once the source is built, run

`
> devenv win_handmade.exe
`
